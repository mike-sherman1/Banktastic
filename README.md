The source code for a sample Windows command line application simulating the software system of a bank. This was written for educational purposes by Mike Sherman and Professor Thomas Fernandez of Florida Atlantic University.

The system is based on a "transducer" that takes strings as input and produces strings as output. The data for the customers of the bank and their accounts are stored locally as text files.

A batch file can be used for testing, and TON and TOFF refer to a timer that can time how long the system takes to do each task. 

The application is not complete, the unassociate customer and account feature is stubbed, and the customer / account lists do not show associations.
