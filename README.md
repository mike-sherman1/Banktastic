The source code for a Windows command line application simulating the software system of a bank. This was written for educational purposes by Mike Sherman and Professor Thomas Fernandez of Florida Atlantic University.

The system is based on a "transducer" that takes strings as input and produces strings as output. The data for the customers of the bank and their accounts is stored locally as text files.

A batch file can be used for testing, and the system can time how long it takes to do each task.
